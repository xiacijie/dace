Hello DaCe team,

I am a compiler engineer intern at Huawei and my colleges and I are studying and discussing this awesome project. We encountered an issue when playing around with DaCe SDFG transformation test cases. 

Here is the issue:

DaCe comes with a syntax which enables user to define a Map
What’s under the Map is the tasklet users defined for computation. As the computation, we can do scalar operations such as integer addition. 

However, if we do tensor(matrix) operation inside that tasklet, for example, A@B or A+B, where A and B are two matrices, DaCe will give us an error. I’ve attached the error messages as a txt file below. 

Here is the concrete code snippet which raises the error. You can try and run this example. 



Look at line #16, where there is a matrix addition A+A. I believe this is the cause of the error. 

Therefore, I would like to know, is tensor operation allowed in such situation? 
If it is allowed, can I know the right syntax to write this?
If not, I would like to know why this is not supported?

Best,
Cijie Xia
